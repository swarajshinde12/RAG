Machine Learning Notes
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data
and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.
Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning – uses labeled data to train models.
2. Unsupervised Learning – finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement Learning – an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.
Neural Networks:
Neural networks are inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes
(neurons). Each neuron applies weights and

Gradient Descent:
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm that adjusts model parameters to minimize loss. It
repeatedly moves in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function.
Model Evaluation:
Common metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
Dataset Split:
Data should be split into:
- Training Set
- Validation Set
- Test Set
